<h1>Usage</h1>

<section id="cookies-usage" class="indent">
    <p>
        I use cookies because I'm nosy and I want to know what the hell you're doing on my website. 👃
    </p>
    <p>
        Tracking is performed by my self-hosted Matomo installation at
        <a href="https://analytics.depau.eu">analytics.depau.eu</a>.

<h1>How to opt-out</h1>

<section id="cookies-turn-off" class="indent">
    <p>
        If you don't want me to see what you're doing on *.depau.eu, I understand. If I were you I wouldn't want me to
        know what I were doing either.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have two options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="multiline">
            Turn on the "Do Not Track" feature of your browser<br>
            This will also turn off tracking for many websites that respect your privacy like this one.
        </li>
        <li class="multiline">
            Opt-out from my analytics by using the form below
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Note</h2>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>
            The form is provided directly by my analytics software, which is not always online. If you don't see it, it
            may be down, or you may be running an ad-blocker (so you're not being tracked anyway).
        </p>
        <p>
            Turning on Do Not Track always works.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Opt-out form</h2>

    <div class="indent">
        <iframe
            style="border: 1px dotted white; height: 250px; width: 100%;"
            src="https://analytics.depau.eu/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=en&backgroundColor=141021&fontColor=f8f8f2&fontSize=12pt&fontFamily=%22Nanum%20Gothic%20Coding%22%2Cmonospace"
